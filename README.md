# Personal Memories Platform

## Project Idea
An cloud storage platform for one's pictures and videos that became too large to be handled by one's local storage. This enables regular random syncing of random pictures and videos for a set size (e.g., 1 GB).

## Objectives
This enables automated fetching of memories when the storage space needed for media exceed the capacity of local devices (e.g., cellphone, laptop).

## Features
- Authentication
- Media Management
- Regular Random Sync
